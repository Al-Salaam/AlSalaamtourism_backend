    "description": "The 3D World Selfie Museum is one of Dubai’s newest attractions. This enormous 21,000 square foot facility, the first of its type in the area and the largest 3D Art Museum in the world, was specifically created for people seeking hassle-free entertainment away from popular tourist destinations. It is perfect for both adults and children because it features close to 200 3D art works spread over its nine zones. The enormous artworks displayed here each have a remarkable trompe l’oeil quality that stimulates your imagination to a whole nother height. The greatest feature is that you’ll get a close-up view of these enormous wonders as you engage with, touch, and obviously, experience them. It seems to provide you the opportunity to enter a mural, portrait, or painting that jumps off the walls or floors and, through your imaginative participation, further develop a scene or tale. As you explore these displays, you may find yourself in tiger-infested jungles or appearing to be swinging from an elephant’s trunk. There are strange experiences that let you engage with Egyptian mummies, pose for photos with a life-size bear, and explore the fascinating underwater environment. Bring your camera with you so that you can comeback with the most incredible and hilarious photos, as there will be plenty of opportunities for fun and hilarity waiting for you at every turn.",

    "description": "Near a 119-acre property in Al Warqa, Dubai Safari Park is ready to provide a real wildlife experience for anyone looking to spend the craziest day possible in the middle of the desert metropolis. This park, the first of its kind in the UAE, was designed with the primary objective of providing an extraordinarily safe and peaceful habitat for all of its residents, including animals that are rescued, through innovative conservation and rehabilitation activities. You may find more than 2400 residents in its four separate sections, including African and Asian Village, Arab and Open Safari Village. All of the animals were carefully collected from different zoos around the world. These sections will easily transport you to the beautiful landscapes of the savannah of Africa & Arabian steppes whilst enabling you to participate in many activities like falconry, camel rides, hunting dogs, etc. They also display a vast range of culture and environments. Don’t pass up the opportunity to ride elephants and feed giraffes, either. Unquestionably, the safari experience which is drive-through in a powerful and safe vehicle is the most exciting feature of this park. This will allow you to get quite close to the fearsome wolves, Bengal tigers, hippopotamuses, and other free-roaming animals at Open Safari Village. In addition, it features the largest elephant and lion drive-through exhibits in the UAE as well as the world’s first crocodile drive-through exhibit. There is also a theater with 1000 seats where you may watch fascinating raccoon and binturong performances. The park’s Wadi sector, which is home to a number of rare bird and animal species, offers a number of leisure and dining options, including a skiing area, kids’ play area, and adventure zone. The park’s main selling point is that it uses solar energy for the majority of its amenities, making it completely energy efficient. Its verdant landscape contains more than 100 different plant species, and it is renowned for its ingenious garbage disposal and water recycling systems, as well as air-conditioned rocks, misting machines, and specially chilled swimming pools that shield the locals from the sweltering summer heat. A trip to the Dubai Safari Park will unquestionably place you at the nexus of knowledge, adventure, and pulse-pounding thrill.",

Visit Kidzania, an interactive kid-sized city where they can be independent, reason logically, and hone their analytical skills without you having to do any effort. It may be difficult to imagine, but all it takes to experience it is a trip to Kidzania with Al Salaam tours. The entire town of Kidzania encourages education via play with the goal of sharpening kids’ social skills while having the most fun possible. At Kidzania, your child can participate in more than 100 role plays, including those of a police officer, dentist, and restaurant owner. Your child may learn the importance of money, transactions, and dealing by using the Kidzania city’s own currency to pay for goods and services. Everything a youngster needs in the city may be found there, including banks, ATMs, hospitals, supermarkets, theaters, pizzerias, and more. The best thing is that every activity has been planned with children’s height, minds, and expectations in mind. Skip the TV, the common slides, and the parks; instead, take your kids to Kidzania so they can learn about the real world in their own innocent way. You’ll keep returning here, we guarantee it, since your kids will enjoy and love it.",

    "description": "\r\nThe governments of Abu Dhabi and France worked together to create the first universal museum of its sort in the Arabian Peninsula. Obviously, the museum’s iconic name says it all. Contrary to its name, however, it is not solely focused on copying the design or content of the Louvre Museum, but rather on developing a logical path of exploration, openness, and unity. Through its vast exhibitions, this innovative and illuminating method provides visitors with the opportunity to discover a wide range of civilizations and periods of world history, compare and thoroughly study them, and most importantly, reflect on their true values. The $650 million museum features permanent installations that cover more than 65,000 square feet and are primarily supported by loans from renowned institutions like the Musée du Louvre, Musée d’Orsay, and Centre Pompidou. It exhibits a wide range of items that represent both ancient and the most recent in contemporary artistic expressions. It will take you through four different eras, from archeology and the beginning of Islam through the classical age and the current era, with its displays organized chronologically. Along with a portion specifically for children, there is also about 20000 square feet of area for transient exhibitions. Most importantly, the Louvre Abu Dhabi Universal Museum provides a spectacular sight from the water. It is a crucial part of the developing Saadiyat Cultural District, which will also house museums like the Zayed National Museum and the Guggenheim Museum. It consists of a number of gorgeous white buildings that resemble an Arabian metropolis. The awe-inspiring design was inspired by the region’s ancient building methods, such as the traditional Falaj water system and interwoven palm leaves that were originally used for roofing. This design is the work of award-winning French architect Jean Nouvel. The elaborate and multi-layered geometric lace dome of this captivating structure, which is complemented by millions of star-like cladding patterns, is probably its most distinctive feature. Elegant perforations in the resulting structure give a beautiful contrast between sunlight and shadow. Without a doubt, the one-of-a-kind museum is impressive in every way—unique concept, diverse offerings, and aesthetically pleasing design!\r\n",

    "description": "A true sanctuary in the desert, Green Planet recreates the incredible environment of the South American Amazon jungle. More than 3000 diverse species of plants and animals live in this vast glass biodome at City Walk, including crocodile lizards, snakes, and toco toucans with orange beeks. It covers an area of around 60,000 square feet. It features an attractive cylinder form with a surface that resembles an origami paper fold. It was created by Meraas and is run by ZoOceanarium Group. A visit to Green Planet is said to give you the impression that you are exploring an actual tropical forest because it has been meticulously designed with characteristics that look just like those found in a rainforest. The main attraction is a gigantic artificial Kapok tree that towers over the entire complex at a height of 25 meters. It is the biggest of its kind in the world and is made of vines and figs. It serves as a life-supporting tree for numerous rare plant, animal, and bird species. Along with adding to the appeal, a sparkling waterfall linked to the tree cools the air with mist. Thanks to its four levels, including Forest Floor, Flooded Rainforest, the Canopy, and the Midstory, this tree, which occupies the middle of the biodome, has covered every aspect of an ecosystem. In fact, you may expect amazing discoveries at every turn, including the Australian Walkabout, the Bat Cave, the Sloth Encounter, the Sugar Glider Encounter, and the Reptile Encounter. Additionally, you’ll get the chance to hold and handle a live python. Using the spiral staircase built around the tree or boarding an elevator will make it easier for you to explore these floors. Don’t pass up the opportunity to cross a rope suspension bridge, which will take you to a tree house and provide you with the only up-close views of the artificial tree, if you’re an adventurer. A visit to Green Planet is a must-do while in Dubai if you want to enjoy lush greenery and a cool ambiance in the middle of a hot desert metropolis, especially if you’re a nature enthusiast or traveling with your family and children.",
